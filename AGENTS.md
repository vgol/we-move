# Agents Handbook

## Python-focused agents
- Follow `instructions/PYTHON_GUIDELINES.md` whenever writing or reviewing Python code. Treat violations (e.g., adding `from __future__ import annotations` in Python 3.14) as blockers unless the file explicitly documents an exception.
- Review the architectural context in `instructions/PIPELINE_BLUEPRINT.md` before implementing or refactoring data pipelines.
